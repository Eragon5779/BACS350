	<h1>About YCH</h1>
	<p>YCH, which stands for Your Character Here, is a form of art auction where the artist creates a piece of art where the characters in the artpiece are sketched roughly; a person can then place a bid, requesting their character be placed in the rough sketch's place. Winning the auction allows the buyer to have a character or persona drawn and depicted in that specific area and pose. The concept is also known as "TCBY," This Could Be You.</p>
