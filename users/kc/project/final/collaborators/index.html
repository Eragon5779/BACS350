					<h1>DuoCartoonist</h1>
					<p>DuoCartoonist are two animators who live and breath animation. As a musician, I am teamed up with the pair as an orchestrator and arranger for projects and concepts they may have under the name "Spiral Harmonies", or for shorthand, Duk.</p>

					<h3>Collaborations</h3>
					<p>
					Run Away is an original orchestration and lyrical song as well made for the "Choices" project of 2016 in collaboration with DuoCartoonist. The song's setting mainly takes place outdoors. The young princess Celestia,
					 depicted in the video thumbnail, is a teenager now.
					 As the song name suggests, it is one of rebellion from a system that has caged her abilities. She wishes to break free and Run Away to be able to truly find something out there better to house her potential.
					  This collaboration was between DuoCartoonist, for the lyrics and basic tune, EileMonty, as the singer, and me, as the orchestrator.

					Midnight Frenzy is an original orchestration and lyrical song made for the "Choices" project in 2016. This was done in collaboration with DuoCartoonist as part of the project. The setting of this song during "Choices"
					 takes place in Unicornia's castle. In this setting, unicorns usually cry on their first night of school, missing their families.
					 The rules there are very strict, especially at bed time, when all must shun and sleep under the watchful eyes of the Night shift... But Luna, the character shown, has a different idea of how the kids first night should be like.
					  This collaboration was between DuoCartoonist, for the lyrics, and basic tune, Emily Koch, as the singer, and me, as the orchestrator.

					<p>
					Diamonds is an orchestral and synthesized piece made in collaboration with the DuoCartoonist team. This song is based on the lives and attitudes of the characters from the series,
					 "Steven Universe", known as the Diamonds.
					 They live on a harsh world with strict ruling. Taking no nonsense, their primary motive is the pursuit of perfection. This collaborations was between DuoCartoonist, for the lyrics and basic tune, and me, for the orchestration.

						Run Away is an original orchestration and lyrical piece made for the "Choices" project in 2016. This was done in collaboration with DuoCartoonist as music for the project. Being one of the first few songs in the animatic series, it
						 takes place in a scene with a character named Celestia, and another trying to coax her into trying flight for the first time. Though she has doubts, toward the end of the song, she is convinced to try.
