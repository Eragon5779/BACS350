					<h1>Midnight Frenzy</h1>
					<p>Midnight Frenzy is an original orchestration and lyrical song made for the "Choices" project in 2016. This was done in collaboration with DuoCartoonist as part of the project.
					The setting of this song during "Choices" takes place in Unicornia's castle. In this setting, unicorns usually cry on their first night of school, missing their families. The rules there are very strict, especially at bed time,
					 when all must shun and sleep under the watchful eyes of the Night shift... But Luna, the character shown, has a different idea of how the kids first night should be like.

					<h1>Luna's Future (Cover)</h1>
					<p>Luna's Future is a cover of a song present in the hit show, "My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic". This instrumental cover is from the episode titled "A Hearth's Warming Tail", which is a play on A Christmas Carol. 
					 Luna, a princess of Equestria, is depicted as the ghost of Hearth Warming's Future, and sings a musical number based on how the actions of the main character will play out if she continues with her plans.

					<h1>Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Trailer Cover</h1>
					<p> This orchestration is a cover of the 2016 release-date trailer for the new, and highly-sought game, Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. As a fan of the Legend of Zelda series myself, and even moreso of the 
					 music, I made it a challenge to myself to orchestrate my own cover of the trailer music present in the trailer.

					<h1>Run Away</h1>
					<p>Run Away is an original orchestration and lyrical song as well made for the "Choices" project of 2016 in collaboration with DuoCartoonist. The song's setting mainly takes place outdoors. 
					The young princess Celestia, depicted in the video thumbnail, is a teenager now. As the song name suggests, it is one of rebellion from a system that has caged her abilities. She wishes to break free
					and Run Away to be able to truly find something out there better to house her potential.

					<h1>Diamonds</h1>
					<p>Diamonds is an orchestral and synthesized piece made in collaboration with the DuoCartoonist team. This song is based on the lives and attitudes of the characters from the series, "Steven Universe", known as the Diamonds.
					 They live on a harsh world with strict ruling. Taking no nonsense, their primary motive is the pursuit of perfection.
